#### matrix
* row,column,zero,null,scalar,diagonal
* addition,subract,multi,div,inverse,transpose
### inverse of matrix
the inverse of matrix is matrix multiplyimg with orginal matrix and result identity matrix.
* For a matrix A, its inverse is A-1. And A.A-1 = I, where I is denoted as the identity matrix.

* identity matrix
* adjoint matrix
* determinant
### eigen values and eigen vectors
#### eigen vectors
* remain same after linear transformantion
#### eigen values
#### uv decomposition
* singular value decomposition
* powerful tool in linear algebra with numerous application in data science and ML
### Principal component analysis (PCA)
* a statistical method that reduces the number of dimensions in a dataset by transforming variables into a smaller set of principal components (PCs).
