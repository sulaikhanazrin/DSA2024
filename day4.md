### STATISTICS
* science of decision making.
* two types-descriptive and inferential
* Descriptive statistics summarizes or describes the characteristics of a data set.
* consists of three basic categories of measures: measures of central tendency, measures of variability (or spread), and frequency distribution.
* Measures of central tendency describe the center of the data set (mean, median, mode).
* Measures of variability describe the dispersion of the data set (variance, standard deviation).
* Measures of frequency distribution describe the occurrence of data within the data set (count).
### HISTOGRAM
* graphical representation of the distribution of data. The histogram is represented by a set of rectangles, adjacent to each other, where each bar represent a kind of data.
### PERCENTILE
* A percentile is the percentage of values in a set of data that fall below a given value. For example, a score in the 80th percentile is greater than 80% of the scores in the set.
* The 25TH PERCENTILE, also known as the first quartile (Q1), is a value that indicates where 25% of a set of data falls below it, and 75% falls above it.
* the 50TH PERCENTILE as the median or second quartile (Q2), and the 75TH PERCENTILE as the third quartile (Q3).
### measures of dispersion
#### Standard deviation
* A popular measure of dispersion that shows the average distance of data points from the mean. A higher standard deviation means the data is more spread out.
#### Range
* The difference between the highest and lowest data values. 
#### Variance
* The average of all squared deviations from the mean. 
#### Coefficient of variation
* A relative measure of dispersion that compares the variability of two data sets with different units. It's usually expressed as a proportion.
