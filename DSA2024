> Today, I grasped some basic concepts and learned how to effectively use several websites and web applications, which are listed below.
### 1.TYPING CLUB
* This platform helps us to improve our typing skills on the keyboard.
* it offers various levels,starting with the leters F and G,to help us develop our typing abiities.
* we can understand our accuracy of writing and time varying while typing.
### 2.GOOGLE DOCS AND MICROSOFT EXCEL
* I already used some basics in both paltforms.
* both platforms can use as data organisation,calculation and analysis.
* excel is a web based application and docs is wed based word processor used in online.
* both provide many formatting options to our data,overall both have distinct purpose in data management.
### 3.GOOGLE SLIDES AND MICROSOFT POWERPOINT
* Google slides is a web-based presentation tool that allows you to create,edit,and share presentations online.
* PowerPoint is a desktop application and can also use as online version.
* both can use for creating presenations including animations,transitions etc
### 4.GOOGLE FORMS
* this is a web based platform used to create surveys,quizes,questions etc
* i already used this in my college days for making registration forms,by this we can take the list of registrations in forms and can edit or view in spreadsheet and make a standard document.
### 5.IDE
* IDE or Integrated Development Environment is a software application thet provide various facilities to programmers for software development.
* this is powerful code editor platform and can test and debug the code.
* this makes easier to manage files,resources and configure large projects.
* a popular IDE tool that i am using is Visual Studio Code.
### 5.VISUAL STUDIO CODE
* this is a IDE tool where we can use as code editor.
* many wide variety of extensions are available in this platform.
* this can debug the codes and also intgrate with git.
* you can customizable themes here,where i am using Synthwave'84 which gives a bright neon theme.
* i used this platform to understand basic python programming about 2 months ago and i will continue my learning more here.
### 6.LaTeX
* typesetting system commonly used for producing high-quality documents, particularly in academia, scientific research, and technical writing.
### 7.OVERLEAF
* cloud-based LaTeX editing platform that allows users to create, edit, and collaborate on documents using LaTeX.
* you can use this platform for various documents like CV and Resume build,Presentation,Articles etc.
* at last we can generate pdf file from this platform use as more accurate and standard documents.
### 8.GOOGLE ANALYTICS
* powerful web analytics service that allows you to track and analyze website traffic and user behavior.
* You can gain demographic information about your audience, including age, gender, location, and interests, allowing for more targeted marketing strategies.
### 9.GITHUB PAGES
* a free hosting service offered by GitHub that allows you to create and publish websites directly from a GitHub repository.
* we can use tracking code integration in github using google analytics.
### 10.STACK EDIT
* An online tool for writing and editing documents using markdown, a simple formatting language.
* as you type,you can see how your formatted document will look,so you can make changes in real time.
* you can track changes revert if needed.
* the text based diagram tool i heard from stackedit is mermaid, that allows you to create diagrams and flowcharts using a simple markdown-like syntax.
### 11.GOOGLE COLAB
a cloud-based platform that allows you to write and execute Python code in a web-based notebook environment.
* You can create notebooks that combine code, text, images, and visualizations, making it easy to document your work and share it with others.

### 1.PROJECT MANAGEMENT
* Learned some thoretical basis of project work and how you should do it.
* term AGILE is learned.
### 2.AGILE METHODOLOGY
*t's an iterative process that breaks projects into phases, or sprints, and involves continuous feedback and reflection.
### 3.JIRA
* project management tool that helps to assign agile methodology.
* learned what is epic,story,task and issue.
* leanred how these are doing in jira as a team work frame.
### 4.SCRUM
* learned from jira
* framework where devolopers,product owner,testers,QAs are having meeting and working together to get fast and better results.
#### DATE 30/10/24(DAY 3)
## EVOLUTION OF COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY
* Understanding the early age use of communication from world war 2
* communication usage device - enigma machine
## BIOLOGY AND TECHNOLOGY
* in biological neuron connections are making store data or memories and learn.
* based on this technology also make an artifical intelligence related to human neuron connection.
* neuro plasicity
* Perceptron-a single-layer neural network linear or a Machine Learning algorithm
## MATHEMATICAL OPERATIONS
* Binary operatins
* GPU Computation is used to tarin neural networks.
## DARPA GRAND CHALLENGE 
* development of autonomous vehicles
### AGI - ARTIFICIAL GENERAL INTELLIGENCE
* human like intelligence and self learning.
## DATA SCIENCE 
* Combining of ML ,AI,DL,mats,statistics,visualisation eda
## BITS AND BYTES 
* used in digital,binary ideas
### IMAGE REPRESENTATION
* understanding about resolution
* visual data into digital format
* black and white
* 3d images
### MACHINE LEARNING
* classified into supervised and unsupervised learning.
* supervised into classification and reggresion
* unsupervised into clustering and association.
* supervised - uses labeled training data
* unsupervised - does not
### PYTHON
* object learning
* high level
* interpreted
### NUMPY AND PANDAS
* NumPy provides support for multi-dimensional arrays
* Pandas builds on top of NumPy, providing tools for data manipulation and analysis.
### DATA SCIENCE LIFECYCLE
* business understanding
* data mining
* data cleaning
* data exploration
* feature engineering
* predictive and modelling
* data visualisation
