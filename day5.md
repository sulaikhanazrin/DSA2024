### Gaussian Curve
* a Gaussian curve (or bell curve) represents how data points are distributed around an average (mean) value.
*  The Gaussian curve is bell-shaped, meaning most of the data points gather around the center (mean), with fewer points as you move further away on either side.
*  A Gaussian curve is symmetric. This means the data on the left side of the mean is a mirror image of the data on the right side.

### normal distribution
* describing how data values are spread around an average (mean) value in a symmetric, bell-shaped curve.
* The "width" or "spread" of the distribution is determined by the standard deviation, 
A small standard deviation creates a narrow curve, meaning data points are close to the mean.
A large standard deviation creates a wider curve, indicating data points are more spread out.

### sampling purpose
* Sampling is the process of selecting a subset of individuals, items, or data points from a larger population to make inferences or draw conclusions about that population. Instead of examining every single element, which may be time-consuming, costly, or impractical.

### sample size
* Sample size refers to the number of individual observations, data points, or participants selected from a larger population for analysis in a study.
### central limit theorem
* The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a fundamental concept in statistics that describes how the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution, regardless of the original population's distribution, as the sample size grows.
* 
### sampling distribution
* A sampling distribution is the distribution of a statistic (such as the mean, median, proportion, etc.) that you would get if you took multiple samples from a population and calculated that statistic for each sample.
### hypothesis testing
* Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make inferences or draw conclusions about a population based on sample data.
### Null Hypothesis
*The null hypothesis is a statement of no effect, no difference, or no relationship. It suggests that any observed difference in the sample data is due to chance or random variation.
* eg: The new drug has no effect on recovery time.
### alternate hypothesis
* The alternative hypothesis is the opposite of the null hypothesis. It suggests that there is an effect, a difference, or a relationship.
* eg:  The new drug improves recovery time.
### p value
* The p-value (probability value) is a key concept in hypothesis testing in statistics. It helps you determine the strength of the evidence against the null hypothesis.
### significance level
* The significance level (often denoted as α) is a key concept in hypothesis testing in statistics. It represents the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true, i.e., the probability of making a Type I error.
* It’s chosen before conducting the test and typically set at 0.05, 0.01, or 0.10.
* You compare the p-value to the significance level to decide whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.
### EQUATIONS
* Z=(X-U)/(σ/root N)
* replace sigma to S if sampling size is used.
