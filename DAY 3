## EVOLUTION OF COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY
* Understanding the early age use of communication from world war 2
* communication usage device - enigma machine
## BIOLOGY AND TECHNOLOGY
* in biological neuron connections are making store data or memories and learn.
* based on this technology also make an artifical intelligence related to human neuron connection.
* neuro plasicity
* Perceptron-a single-layer neural network linear or a Machine Learning algorithm
## MATHEMATICAL OPERATIONS
* Binary operatins
* GPU Computation is used to tarin neural networks.
## DARPA GRAND CHALLENGE 
* development of autonomous vehicles
### AGI - ARTIFICIAL GENERAL INTELLIGENCE
* human like intelligence and self learning.

* Combining of ML ,AI,DL,mats,statistics,visualisation eda
## BITS AND BYTES 
* used in digital,binary ideas
### IMAGE REPRESENTATION
* understanding about resolution
* visual data into digital format
* black and white
* 3d images
### MACHINE LEARNING
* classified into supervised and unsupervised learning.
* supervised into classification and reggresion
* unsupervised into clustering and association.
* supervised - uses labeled training data
* unsupervised - does not
