### 1.PROJECT MANAGEMENT
* Learned some thoretical basis of project work and how you should do it.
* term AGILE is learned.
### 2.AGILE METHODOLOGY
*t's an iterative process that breaks projects into phases, or sprints, and involves continuous feedback and reflection.
### 3.JIRA
* project management tool that helps to assign agile methodology.

## EVOLUTION OF COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY
* Understanding the early age use of communication from world war 2
* communication usage device - enigma machine
## BIOLOGY AND TECHNOLOGY
* in biological neuron connections are making store data or memories and learn.
* based on this technology also make an artifical intelligence related to human neuron connection.
* neuro plasicity
* Perceptron-a single-layer neural network linear or a Machine Learning algorithm
## MATHEMATICAL OPERATIONS
* Binary operatins
* GPU Computation is used to tarin neural networks.
## DARPA GRAND CHALLENGE 
* development of autonomous vehicles
### AGI - ARTIFICIAL GENERAL INTELLIGENCE
* human like intelligence and self learning.
## DATA SCIENCE 
* Combining of ML ,AI,DL,mats,statistics,visualisation eda
## BITS AND BYTES 
* used in digital,binary ideas
### IMAGE REPRESENTATION
* understanding about resolution
* visual data into digital format
* black and white
* 3d images
### MACHINE LEARNING
* classified into supervised and unsupervised learning.
* supervised into classification and reggresion
* unsupervised into clustering and association.
* supervised - uses labeled training data
* unsupervised - does not
### PYTHON
* object learning
* high level
* interpreted
### NUMPY AND PANDAS
* NumPy provides support for multi-dimensional arrays
* Pandas builds on top of NumPy, providing tools for data manipulation and analysis.
### DATA SCIENCE LIFECYCLE
* business understanding
* data mining
* data cleaning
* data exploration
* feature engineering
